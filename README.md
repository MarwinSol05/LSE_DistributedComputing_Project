# LSE_DistributedComputing_Project

## Dataset: Data from past 20 years obtained from Yahoo Finance about the 503 stocks that constitute the S&P 500 Index

## Aim: To understand the efficiency of machine learning algorithms in terms of time (time complexity) over cloud computing

## Outcome: Time complexity of the algorithms to produce result decreases with improvement in computational resources
